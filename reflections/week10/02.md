## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
  List is the new term for array in C#. It is also a generic type, so you can make many different kinds of lists.
2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
  List.Add(), List.Contains(), List.Find(). Adding to a list is very helpful because you can take in much more data. Contains would be helpful because you could null check the list before trying to do a function. Find is helpful in case you want to find a list by something inside of it.
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
  You could use list.Find(), it would be the best way to do it because you could find by id or anything inside the list. Once you have the list, you can go through it and assign it to a variable, or anything else too.
