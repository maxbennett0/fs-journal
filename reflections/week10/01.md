## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
  Value - Holds data value within it's memory space, Reference - Stores the address of where the data is located instead of directly, Pointer - Holds a copy of the reference at that place in time
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
  Bool, byte, cahr, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. There are types with a u in front, many names for similar types, bytes are a data type.

  References hold the address or the route to the actual data, and value types hold that actual data that the reference is referencing.
