## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
  A pseudo class is a class inside of an element, and I would use :hover, :required, and :checked
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
  Specificity is used to determine whether or not an element is being chosen over another, and you could use it to your benefit when you have two elements named the same thing and need to be able to have different properties for each
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
  Since !important is used to make it the most important css code, having a lot of !important tags could ruin the specificity of your other properties and ruin your css, another problem could be forgetting you have an !important tag on one of your properties and debugging for much longer than would be necessary
