# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  I was surprised that I understood CSS a lot better than I thought I would. I had never really tried to learn it in the past, so I was worried that it would be a problem.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  I didn't expect to understand bootstrap very quickly. The first day was very confusing and the rows and columns didn't make much sense to me but by the checkpoint I had a better understanding.
- What are you struggling with?
  I am still struggling with how I use containers, rows, and columns and how they apply to the usual HTML format.
- What would you count as a victory?
  I am very proud of the checkpoint. I thought I wasn't going to get much done and have to work on it a lot when I got home. However, even though it doesn't look the prettiest, it is still functional, and that's what I care about.
