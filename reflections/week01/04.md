## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
  keeping the concept user-focused, clarifying and defining website features, and they're just easy to make.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
  low fidelity, mid fidelity, and high fidelity. low is useful for when you just have an idea but need to make the details/user flow. mid is good for a more accurate representation of the website. and high is good for when you know exactly what you need for each specific part of the site
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
  I think they are worth it when using a mid/high fidelity frame because anything less is just easier to code on the fly without much pre thought.
