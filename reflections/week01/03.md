## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
  Using color and weight as a way to convey more important info to the reader. I would usually just make the font bigger but I think that is a really good tip that I will be using in the future
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
  I think a good design can show the reader what they want them to see, for example you could have a scrollable page with the info you want them to know first and the not as important info later in the page
