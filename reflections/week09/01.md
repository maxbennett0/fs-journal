## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
  We used the scrum ideology for our group workflow. We also wanted to use firebase with our application to allow for uploading files.
2. What went well so far?
  I think as a group we were all able to work together, especially when it came to debugging. Every time there was an issue, we all came to the computer to work on fixing the problem.
3. What would you do differently? Why?
  If I could do it differently, I would get more help from TAs. An issue of mine would be always wanting to figure out the issue myself, but that costed a lot of time.
