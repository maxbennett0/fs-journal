## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


I have really enjoyed this course. I felt challenged, but I never felt like I didn't know enough. Having the assistance of TAs and the teachers was really helpful, and they helped me understand why the code acted the way it was and could also help debug whenever I needed help too. The only really difficult parts of the course were of course, learning MVC pattern and Vue. My concerns about this project are just about the scope. I'm worried about it being a very big project, and having to time crunch everything. I will just have to try to code incredibly quickly but also quite thorough, to prevent spending more time than is necessary on issues that I encounter. I have enjoyed getting to know everyone in the cohort as well as learning Vue. This course has been a lot of fun and a great experience.
