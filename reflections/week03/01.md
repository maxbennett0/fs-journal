## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
  Exports solve the issue of needing elements from other javascript files
2. How does export differ from export default?
  Export default differs from export because export default is used when there is only one file to import, so it doesn't need to have the specifics
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
  Encapsulation is a large part of using the system. You don't want anyone to have complete access to all the functions, especially the ones that manipulate data.
