## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
  its always a good idea to have a plan before coding because you need to know what needs to come next, and the order of importance for the tasks.
2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
  Google has been a great tool for finding the answers I need before I go ask a TA. If I can't find it on google, I troubleshoot by myself for a little bit before finally caving and asking someone for help.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
  Make sure to plan not too much but not too little before you start coding. Always use google when doing research, even if the problem seems very complex. Make sure to write comments for EVERYTHING.
