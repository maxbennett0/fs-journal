## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
  Scope is the place that the variable declaration is available, for example a variable is globally scoped if declared outside of any functions.
2. What is Hoisting ?
  Hoisting is a javascript thing where declarations are moved to the top of their scope. So that basically means that despite how you wrote the code, it could still be ran differently from that.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
  Const would be good if you wanted a variable that can't change even if you change the variable. Variables are good if you want to declare and have an undefined variable. Let is just a good declaration tool overall.
